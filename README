HTML-BASED CUSTOM ENTITY REFERENCES are unfortunately not supported in 
text/html (and XML support is spotty), despite their convenience in
authoring, especially for non-technical authors or those who wish to
share and utilize documents stored on the local file system without
a server to execute substitutions.

All of the following client-side approaches are possible, though they may be
technically discouraged for universal access since some people might not 
enable JavaScript or CSS (and XML support is currently inconsistent as 
far as entities, particularly with regard to external entities).

The example files detail the usage, but to summarize, the following means of
defining entities are possible (not including XML):
1) Via XML
    a) Advantages:
        i) Does not require script file
        ii) Behavior defined in a standard
        iii) Easy to write definitions and references
    b) Disadvantages:
        i) Browser support varies with single-point-of-failure for 
            externally defined entities not found in the internal
            subset and no fallbacks despite the XML specification's
            recommendations.
        ii) Requires less-used XML syntax and application/xhtml+xml 
            content-type
2) Via use of the CSS content property
    a) Advantages: 
        i) Does not require script file
        ii) Allows external file usage
    b) Disadvantages:
        i) Browser support varies
        ii) Somewhat cumbersome to write
        iii) Does not allow numeric definitions as allowed by the JavaScript 
            code (though the latter are really redundant anyways since HTML 
            supports numeric character references)).
        iv) Does not allow arbitrary HTML substitution--only text
        v) Requires CSS to be enabled
3) Via JavaScript:
    a) Approaches:
        i) Via definition of properties on a "JSEntityMap" global JavaScript 
            object defined before the entities.js file is included
        ii) Via HTML meta elements with name set to "entity" and "content" 
            attribute set to "{entity name}={entity name}"; script also
            allows retrieval of meta elements defined in an iframe in the
            body of the document so that this approach will also allow 
            external file definitions
    b) Advantages:
        i) Can substitute with arbitrary HTML
        ii) Should work well in all well-used browsers
        iii) Easy to write definitions and references
        iv) Allows external file usage
    c) Disadvantages:
        i) Requires JavaScript enabled by user
        ii) Requires inclusion and execution of external JavaScript file,
            waiting for content-load (and iframe load, if iframe definitions 
            are used).
