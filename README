HTML-BASED CUSTOM ENTITY REFERENCES are unfortunately not supported in text/html 
(only application/xhtml+xml allows them if the processor supports entities (it is possible only
internal ones may be supported) which should theoretically support at least a non-single-point-of-failure
fallback, but most browsers cause the document to fail completely on encountering an entity reference).

The JavaScript and CSS (and XML) approaches are all possible, though technically discouraged since
some people might not enable JavaScript or CSS (and XML support is currently inconsistent as far
as entities, particularly with regard to external entities).

JavaScript-utilized entity declarations offer the benefit of being able to customize the code so
as to define the replacement element entirely (e.g., to allow treating an entity as a kind of
text-driven widget).

3. Can also make entity declarations in CSS, though not the numeric ones (which are really redundant 
anyways since HTML supports numeric character references); an advantage is that it does not require 
loading an extra file as with the JavaScript approach, though it is a little more "technical" to write.
